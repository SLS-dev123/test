   <b>Defination,</b>
   <p>Money Laundering is the practice of distinguishing illegally obtained funds so that they seem legal.</br>
   It is a crime in many durisdictions wiyh varying definations.It is a key operation ot the uderground economy.
   Due to the appelation <i>feymania</i> as used in Cameroon, thi is equivilent to swindling and scamming.
   It is ill-geotten wealth, illegal business with disjoint accounts which cannot be checked with checked or accessed
   such as smuggling, illegal sells of arms, organised crimes; drug trafficking,prostitution,embezzelment,insider trading,
   bribery,slot machines and computer fraud schemes. </p>

  <center>Origins of Money Laundering</center>
  <p>Early money launderers cliam that, it originated from certain laws that prohibited the sells of certain alcoholic drinks
  and gambling which intially raised alot of money to the dealers. These then forced some American gansters to use several ways 
  of distinguishing the source of these funds generated from the sale of these alcoholic drinks and gambling e.g.the slot machine</p>
 
  <center>Causes of Money Launderingin Cameroon</center>
   <ul>
   <li>High unemployment</li>
   <li>Increased poverty</li>
   <li>Low salaries</li>
   <li>Family hardship</li>
  </ul>
  <center>Consequences of Money Laundering</center>
   <ul>
    <li>Affects business and economic development</li>
    <li>It cuts 2 to 5% of the world gross domestic product</li>
    <li>It disturbs regular authority from doing effective work</li>
   </ul>
  <p> I say it better to stay away from Money laundering because it could be addictive just like gambling, and it is illegal and one
  could go to jail for it PROGRAMMING LABORATORY
